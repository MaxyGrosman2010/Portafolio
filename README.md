# Portafolio

This is the repository with all the information of how i made this portafolio page.
This was created through using the technology Next.JS, i through it was a nice and easy way
to ease me into learning Next while doing something productive that helps with my overall
presentation regarding my career. At the same time, im also learning Typescript to make my
code more clear direct and understandable, while working on this proyect, the idea is not to take to long, but also to make it well.

Seeing as the information of this page is mostly links and images which i can easy set up
or obtain through the internet, i didn' saw the need of creating a working Back-End for
request.

Down below there is the ways to run this repository through next, which i through it was useful to keep as a quick access for now. As time passes and i get better at making README's for proyects when i come back this page i will update it to make it more professional.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
